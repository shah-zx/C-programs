// Here we will be learning about arrays in C //

// An array is a collection of data items of the same data type.
// Items are stored in contigous memory location
// It can also store the collection of derived data types  , such as pointers  , structures etc. 
// A one dimensional array is a like a list.
// A two dimensional array is like a table.
// The C language places no limits n the number of dimensions in an array.
// Some texts refer to one dimensional arrays as vectors  , two dimensional arrays as matrices  , and use the genaeral , 
// term arrays when the number of dimensions
// is unspecified or unimportant //

// Why do we need arrays :- //

// Mkes the code more organised and readable //
// If you were to store the marks in a test of 56 students  , creating 56 variables will be making the program look more cluttered and messy.
// Solution to this is array !
// We can create arrays of integers and store the consecutive marks corresponding to the roll number in the array.

// Advantages of arrays :-

// It is used to represent multiple data items of same type by using only single name.
// Accessing an item in a given array is very fast !
// 2D arrays makes it easy in mathematical applications as it is used to represent a matrix.


// Properties of array :-

// Data in an array is stored in contiguous memory locations
// Each element of an array is of same size
// Any element of the array with given index can be accessed very quickly by using its address which can be calculated using the base address and the index

// Syntax of an array :-
// Data_type arrayname[size];
// data_type arrayname[size] = {1,2,3,34,45,56,7,7,9,9....} // size not required in this case //
// We can also initialize the array one by one by accessing it using its index 
// name[0] = 0;
